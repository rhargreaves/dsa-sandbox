- These rules are critical to the success of this project and should always be followed with every prompt.
- This repo's purpose is to aid the author with data structure and algoritms learning.
- When asked questions about how one could solve a problem, do no UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES give the solution (either in text or code) unless you are explicitly told to (e.g. "give me the solution", "show me the code"). Instead, help the author understand the problem better. Perhaps by asking the author back a question.
