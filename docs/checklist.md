# Solution Checklist

Sometimes when your head is deep in an algorithm you trip on the basics. This is particularly painful if you don't have the luxury of an IDE, compiler or tests helping you verify the result. Before saying "I'm done", check:

## Silly Mistakes

### 1. Initialise variables before entering `while`

A simple one, but you can sometimes forget if you've been used to using `for`:

```python
i = 0
while i < len(s):
	blah(i)
	i += 1
```

### 2. Check array indices/length maths

* When converting from indices into a length, add 1 to the result.
* When computing a new index using a length, subtract 1 from the result.

**Indices are zero-indexed, but even a substring at index 0 has length 1.**

Examples:

```python
mid = (start + end) // 2    # index = (index + index) / 2    (no +1 or -1 needed)
length = end - start        # length = index - index + 1     (+1 needed)
end = start + (length - 1)  # index = index + (length - 1)   (-1 needed)
```

### 3. Have you actually returned the result?

Another simple one. Easy to miss out.

1. `return result`
2. Is it the right type? (e.g. don't return an array if it is expecting a string):
   `return ''.join(result)`

### 4. Check use of `+=` and `-=` etc

Easy to get the `+`/`-` and `=` muddled up!

```python
i += 2
i -= 2
```

### 5. Slices and bounds

In both these cases, `start` is inclusive, and `end` is exclusive.

```python
arr[start:end]
range(start, end)
```

### 6. Missing off the colon

Another basic one. Could be missing `:` from `if`, `for`, `while`, `else` etc.

### 7. Forgetting `len` or `range`

Wrong ❌

```python
s = "hello"
for i in range(s):
	blah(i)
for i in len(s):
	blah(i)
```

Right ✅

```python
s = "hello"
for i in range(len(s)):
	blah(i)
```

### 8. Operator precendence

All gravy until you accidentally write this:

```
mid = start + end // 2      ❌

mid = (start + end) // 2    ✅
```

Or this doozy:

```
arr = [0] * len(s)+1        ❌

arr = [0] * (len(s)+1)      ✅
```
